# 🛡️ ChromeExtension-VTScanner

## Overview

**ChromeExtension-VTScanner** is a Python-based malware detection tool that scans all locally installed Google Chrome extensions. It compresses each extension, calculates its SHA256 hash, and submits it to the [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) API to identify any malicious components.

This project is ideal for cybersecurity students, blue team analysts, or anyone interested in browser hygiene and extension threat detection.

## Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Chrome Extension Scanning**: Detects all installed Chrome extensions from the default directory.
- 🧱 **ZIP Compression + SHA256 Hashing**: Each extension is zipped and hashed before submission.
- ☁️ **VirusTotal API Integration**: Automatically uploads zipped files and fetches scan results.
- 📊 **Real-time Threat Detection**: Clearly flags malicious extensions using VT’s threat intelligence.
- 🧹 **Temporary File Cleanup**: Deletes zip files after scanning to save storage.
